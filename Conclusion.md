How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
    Members use the service consistently throughout the year, even during colder months like January and February. This suggests they may rely on the bikes for commuting or regular travel purposes.
    Casual riders, on the other hand, have a much more seasonal pattern of usage. Their peak usage occurs during the summer months (June to August), indicating that casual riders are more likely to use the service for leisure, tourism, or recreational purposes.
    Members tend to maintain a more steady usage, whereas casual riders seem to be more influenced by seasonal factors, such as weather or holidays.

Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
    Casual riders may consider purchasing annual memberships if they recognize the value and savings from more frequent use. For example:
    If a casual rider finds themselves biking more often in the summer, they might see that the cost of a membership is cheaper than repeated casual payments over time.
    Casual riders may become more familiar with the service and realize its convenience as a commuting option, even in months outside of summer.
    The company could target frequent casual riders and showcase cost comparisons, demonstrating how much they could save annually by becoming a member, especially if they ride more than a certain number of times in a season.
    Offering discounted rates or trial memberships during peak summer months could be a way to convince casual riders to test the benefits of membership and encourage a transition from occasional usage to a more regular routine.

How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
    Targeted Ads:
        Seasonal promotions: During the summer months, the company can use targeted ads (through social media, email campaigns, and search engines) to promote seasonal discounts or trial memberships for casual riders.
        Ads could highlight cost savings, showing casual riders how much they can save by becoming a member compared to paying per ride.
    Personalized Marketing:
        The company could leverage data from casual riders (e.g., ride frequency, and times of year they ride) to send personalized email offers suggesting membership based on their riding habits. For example, if a rider takes more than a certain number of trips during the summer, they can receive personalized offers highlighting the benefits of becoming a member.
    Promote Member Perks:
        The company could run campaigns that highlight the benefits of membership, such as unlimited rides, priority access, or discounts. This could attract casual riders who might be unaware of the extra perks that come with membership.
    Influencers and Social Media:
        The company can collaborate with local influencers or bloggers who use the bikes regularly and ask them to showcase how being a member has improved their experienceâ€”focusing on commuting convenience, cost savings, and reliability.
    Referral Programs:
        Casual riders could be incentivized through referral programs, where members who refer friends to sign up for annual memberships get ride credits or rewards. This can encourage both word-of-mouth marketing and a stronger community of riders.

Conclusion:
    We know that members are most likely using bikes as a main transportation method and that casual cyclists use bikes as a leisure activity. We see that there is an increase in trips during summer times and a decrease in trips during fall and winter, we
    can set up seasonal promotions and ads since people are more likely to bike during good weather. We can also emphasize cost savings and convenience to attract casual riders who might be on the fence about becoming members. Since casual riders tend to use bikes 
    for longer rides on weekends, Cyclistic could offer weekend promotions or special pricing for casual riders, encouraging them to explore membership benefits. The shorter, more consistent ride times of members suggest they benefit from using the service for short, frequent trips.
    The company could highlight this benefit in their marketing, showing casual riders how they could save money on multiple short trips by becoming members. The company could also emphasize tourist-friendly routes, scenic rides, and weekend passes that cater to casual riders who use the service for recreation.
